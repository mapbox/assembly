/**
 * The `icon` class must be appled to an `<svg>` element.
 * Inside the `<svg>`, insert a `<use>` element whose `xlink:href` attribute
 * points to an icon loaded by `assembly.js`. All icons are referenced
 * by the string `#icon-{name}`. By default, icons inherit size from their calculated text size.
 * Change the size of icons by applying `w{size}` and `h{size}` classes to the svg.
 *
 * Be aware that *icons are block-level*.
 *
 * To see a list of all available icons, visit [the icons page](/assembly/icons).
